PS 7: Problem 0
Put your response to the reading below.
I think that this article was very interesting, as I’ve always been interested in weird ways of computation like moss, crabs, and now DNA. I think that the idea of using chemical reactions as a way to compute is a very super duper interesting problem and I think it could be a very promising field. Obviously we just worked with DNA because we are made up of it, but I think in the future it will likely be easier to work with molecules that could make the process of producing the “biological computer” faster. I think that obviously the biggest limitation is that DNA is very hard to produce and its applications would be very niche, maybe to the hardest of problems even. I don’t foresee myself having DNA in a cup be the medium I play videogames on, but I think the idea of molecular computers is very promising because computers get so much bigger and bigger than minifying them this much would be interesting and promising on the scale of large scale computing above anything we have currently.
