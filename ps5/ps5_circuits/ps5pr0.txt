Grace Hopper was instrumental in creating the first compilers which revolutionized computer science. The difference between writing in just assembly and machine code is amazing, the human brain isn’t trained to read 1’s and 0’s, Grace was right in pushing so hard for english compilers. As someone who is currently making a compiler for their own programming language, grace is really an inspiration for me as making a compiler is not easy work, especially when no one else has done it and computers were very very slow. It’s also amazing to me that she helped develop COBOL, because I know a few people now who still use COBOL, I didn’t know it was so old and pivotal to the history of computer science. Overall I will never forget the contribution Grace Hopper has made now, I never knew about her but now that I do appreciate her work a whole lot. I don’t understand how she managed to come up how to make a compiler, it blows my mind.
