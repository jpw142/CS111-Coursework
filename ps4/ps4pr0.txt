PS 4: Problem 0

I absolutely 100% do not believe in the predictions cited in this article. Yes AI is being improved exponentially but I don’t believe AI will ever be as good as humans or better as in the end it is a machine, since we are able to map all of its neurons and such in a database there is always a way to exploit it. The only reason why humans are infallible is because our database is made out of goop, mush, and meat. There is a study that took a chat AI and then was able to type a sequence of random words that confused it and made it say blatantly wrong answers, and that this will likely always be a problem with AI no matter what structure or architecture. The only reason why this doesn’t work on humans is because we can’t algorithmically find the sequence of words because our brain is made of meat and we don’t have enough time to try all the combinations. I’m not too worried about AI taking over us and surpassing us because if I just say a random 100 word string it will explode. I am excited for the future with much more developed medicine and nanotechnology but I sincerely doubt his fantastical views of things with AI rewriting our DNA and being implanted in our brains and bringing every dead human ever back to life. I wouldn’t even want to come back alive after I’m dead, and it wouldn’t even be me, it would just be a copy of me. If my kids scanned my brain and put me into a computer 100 years after I died and it was somehow my consciousness I would be so upset at them and I would pull the plug. I feel so bad that he lost his father but I simply don’t believe that part of his vision of the future and think it's severely influenced by his lost father.
